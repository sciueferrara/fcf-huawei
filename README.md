# Federated Collaborative Filtering

Unofficial implementation of the algorithm described in the paper [Federated Collaborative Filtering for Privacy-Preserving Personalized Recommendation System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09888v1.pdf) by Muhammad Ammad-ud-din et al.

This Python implementation is mainly based on sparse computations performed with the library [scipy](https://www.scipy.org).

The results of this implementation with the datasets MovieLens 1M, Amazon Digital Music, LibraryThing and Foursquare are available within the following papers:
* [FedeRank: User Controlled Feedback with Federated Recommender Systems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-72113-8_3) (ECIR 2021)
* [How to put users in control of their data in federated top-N recommendation with learning to rank](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3412841.3442010) (SAC 2021)
